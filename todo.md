### LAP 2 Code Challenge

We visit GitHub a lot! Let's make our own repo tracker so we can get an overview of our work without visiting the site itself.

Base your design aesthetic on a minimalist version of a GitHub repositories page.

You will be working in pairs for this challenge and teaming up with another pair to give feedback via PR review.

## Requirements

- Your app should make use of React
- Your repo tracker should have an input for users to give their GitHub username
- After submitting their username, use the GitHub API to retrieve that user's list of repos
- When selecting a repo, a User should be shown some data about that repo eg. issue count, stargazers, forks etc.
